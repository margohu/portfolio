<h3>My name is Margo, future software developer. Nice to see You here. I`m 34 years old and for myself I am just an ordinary guy who lives in an old countryhouse near Polva city and who is wide-opened for new skills and knowledges the world has to offer.</h3>
<h3>Currently I have a job and school in Tartu, so basically I`m there in every working day. I am a student of junior software developer at Tartu Tartu Vocational Education Center and before current speciality I was learning to become system administrator at the same school. And before that senior telecommunications technician speciality at Voru County Vocational Education Center. Last years has been quite exiting and well-trained for me.</h3>
<h3>I`m working as a system administrator in Tartu and building different vundamentals for webpages, apps and so on. There were a little thought inside me that I want to know what will happen next. What will happen when I built a server, make it safe and for example- install wordpress on it. I wanted to know and that is the reason I applied for school again. I can say that I do not know nothing about software development but I am willing to learn (Ofcourse it`s not so bad..). I just want to know what happens next when I finish my new server configuration. And ofcourse, to be honest, I want to have freedom in the future. Is it financial freedom or free- from- office freedom, let it be undercover for now.</h3>
<h3>A few words also about my hobbies and interests. I like to travel. My last work was on board different cruise ship`s almost 12 years so travelling around the world is inside my heart. For above- I love Spain and Latvia!
I collect commemorative coins. You know those 2- euro coins that every European Country has right to issue two pieces of them in every year? Yes. Those ones. I have about 210 pieces from total of 522. One interesting fact- most expensive 2 euro commemorative coin is 2007 Monaco`s '25th anniversary of the death of princess Grace'. It costs about 4000-5000 euros. I don`t have it. Yet.
And theres something about wood. I love to give new life for old wooden things. Is it a small or big- I love the spirit and life in it.</h3>
<h3>That was a little introduction who am I. I think it is enough because seems to me that all IT-Guys are quite quiet. So am I.</h3>
